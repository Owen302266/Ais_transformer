# Ais_transformer

To some reason, my direction is changed and won't do anything with Ais in the future, so I open source the code. I think this is a demo for "ais llm", using the training method of prediction. It can be used with fine tune for predict, classify tasks.

Here's some method to improve:
- change the positional embedding method(connect with longitude and altitude)
- split the time stamp
- use the delta time to train the model
- split the longitude and altitude into more vector, in order to improve the training accuracy

Hope it's helpful.
